This is javaiPacman, a intelligent pacman game written in Java.

The original goal of the project is to demonstrate how randomness contributes to the intelligent movements of the ghosts.

I think the movements of the ghosts makes this game interesting.

Note the one rule of ghosts' movement - they are not allowed to reverse course.
